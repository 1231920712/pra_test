The vases of the Dirce and Prado/Fienga Painters themselves, who must have flourished between c. 380 and 360 B.C., would also seem, on the evidence of their proveniences, to have been made in Sicily, and I should no longer wish to classify the former's work, as was done in PP but not in LCS, as Early Paestan. Some of the vases, however, by painters associated with these two artists have mainland proveniences, and this raises the problem of whether such vases are to be regarded as imports or of local manufacture. It is unfortunate that the proveniences of so many of the relevant vases, especially those found in the nineteenth century, are either not recorded or else are unreliable; those, however, which can be established with certainty tend to favour "

There are, however, certain points of difference—on the kraters in this division only sal tires accompany the meanders, which on nos. 14, 17-19 are stopt; all the reverses show static scenes; a white stephane with small rays comes into fashion for women (e.g. nos. 13, 14, 16-19, 22) in contrast to the plain bandeau preferred in (i); naked or half-draped women make a more frequent appearance, with rounded breasts and clearly defined nipples (e.g. nos. 14 and 17). The mythological subjects, which added to the interest of the vases in (i), disappear almost completely except on no. 15, which seems best placed here in view of the similarity between its reverse and those of nos. 13 and 14, though on them the drawing is more precise. In general, THE SICILIAN FORERUNNERS  27 women tend to have rather small mouths, with lips fairly tightly compressed (e.g. nos. 13-14, 16, 18, 22). Greater use is also made of added white to indicate rising ground (nos. 14—19). On the whole, however, the differences seem less significant than the similarities, and could well be accounted for by the normal developments taking place in the painter's style. Calyx-kraters "

He is probably an early Campanian artist, but should be considered here for the parallels to early Paestan which his vases afford us. Perhaps the most remarkable feature of his kraters is his practice of framing the pictures on their obverses between vertical reserved bands decorated with wave-pattern and with a band of egg-pattern across the top on nos. 77-8 and 80, and a row of dentils on no. 79, perhaps intended to convey the suggestion of a building of which the vertical 'posts' support, as it were, an architrave. This dentil pattern, in a slightly simpler form with black alternating with reserved areas, occurs quite frequently on later Sicilian vases, usually just below the pictures, where it sometimes gives the effect of a stage-floor supported by posts;4 it reappears in Paestan on the Cadmus and Opheltes kraters by Python (nos. 2/241-2 below). The reverses show very clearly the strong influence of the Prado/Fienga Group in both the composition and the treatment of the drapery; the floral patterns recall those of nos. 48-9 above. They also seem to have inspired some of those on early Campanian vases in the Cassandra and Parrish Groups. The phlyax actor on the former Ruesch krater (no. 77) is inscribed ZIKQN, which at least suggests a Sicilian connection, and his costume should be compared with that of the phylakes on nos. 99-101 and 105 in Chapter III.

Many significant differences between Sicilian after c. 360 B.C. and Paestan may be observed, both in the choice and treatment of shapes (e.g. the calyx-krater and the skyphoid pyxis) and in the pattern-work and the rendering of the drapery (plain black borders rather than dot-stripe; the continuing use of the white-studded girdle), as well as in the subject-matter where themes with a theatrical association (both tragic and comic) appear on a higher proportion of the vases. As has already been pointed out, it was the second generation of Sicilian vase-painters whose work provided the models for early Campanian and Paestan, with the result that these two fabrics reflect the influence of Attic to a much lesser extent than do Lucanian and Apulian, which had begun half a century earlier, before the substantial decline in Attic imports which was one of the consequences of the Peloponnesian War. Paestan, perhaps more than Campanian, remained faithful to "
298,Plymouth,coll. ,Ht. 32, , ,"and pattern-work. Chapter III. THE TRANSITION FROM SICILIAN TO PAESTAN The preceding chapter listed a number of vases, many of which were found in Sicily and had probably been made there. These vases provide the background, in regard to shape, decorative patterns and subject-matter, to the rise and development of the red-figure fabrics of Campania and Paestum. It seems highly likely that at least some of the vases there discussed were actually made in Campania; in any case they lead directly into the earliest schools of Campanian red-figure, the products of which run at first along lines closely parallel to those of early Paestan. The present chapter deals with the main groups of vases, also of probable Sicilian origin, which seem to lead directly to Paestan; indeed, several of them (nos. 85-7, 94—5, 98-100, 102-3) had already been assigned to that fabric in PP, PPSupp and PAdd. 1. THE SCOGLITTI PAINTER This artist was identified in LCS, pp. 216-7, where nos. 84, 86 and 87 were ascribed to his hand; in PPSupp, nos. 85-7 had already been grouped with Early Paestan and placed in the section devoted to the 'Followers of the Dirce Painter'. That the four vases (nos. 84—7) listed below are the work of a single painter seems almost certain "

On nos. 85-6 the meanders, which are stopt, are accompanied by saltire squares with solid black triangles in the intersections, on no. 84 with hollow triangles instead. As we shall see, the draped youths on nos. 85 and 86 have close affinities with those on early Paestan, where also parallels to the running women on nos. 87 and 88 will be found; the beaded bandeau worn by the woman on no. 87 is also common in Paestan.

THE TRANSITION FROM SICILIAN TO PAESTAN  49 Apollo refused to do this, Herakles seized the Delphic tripod, and the two were reconciled only through the intervention of Zeus and Athena, a theme extremely popular in Attic vase-painting. In the phlyax version the scene is entirely different. Herakles stands on a three-legged table, perhaps intended as a parody of the tripod, and holds out a dish of cakes in one hand to Apollo, who has fled to the roof of the temple, still holding his bow and laurel-branch. In his other hand Herakles has his knotty club, ready to deal a blow to Apollo should he venture to take one of the cakes and thus probably cause him to fall into the louterion which stands immediately beneath him. To right is a third phlyax, presumably Iolaos, who holds up his right hand and seems to be shouting at Apollo. In the top left-hand corner hangs the mask of a white-haired and bearded phlyax (type L), and above Herakles is a wreath in added white to fill the otherwise empty space. The attribution of the vase, however, raises difficult problems.

Both sign with eypcttpe, using the imperfect rather than the aorist eypayE, which is the regular form on Attic vases.1 Asteas is a rare name; it occurs only once in literature, as the name of a Pythagorean philosopher at Tarentum,2 though it appears in several Greek inscriptions.3 The vase-painter always spells his name with a double sigma in the first syllable,4 but this spelling is not found elsewhere and may be regarded as a mannerism. The name Python is of more frequent occurrence;5 it was also that of an Athenian potter who made cups signed by Epiktetos and Douris.6 Reference has already been made (p. 9) to the similarity between the styles of "

Certain changes and developments will be observed in the pattern-work, the drawing of the figures and the rendering of the drapery, but they do not appear inconsistent with those that might normally be expected to take place in the quarter-century or so of the artist's activity.

We should look particularly at the features of the five figures on the obverse; their faces are strongly defined, with a high brow, marked by two short parallel lines; the pupil of the eye is large, the eyebrow sometimes arched; the nose has an outward curve, at times with a pointed tip; the lower lip is full and fleshy, the chin prominent and rounded.

EARLY VASES BY ASTEAS The early vases of Asteas, most of which precede the more elaborately decorated vases which bear his signature (Chapter V) or have been attributed to his hand (Chapter VI), are remarkable for their uniformity of shape, style and decoration. About half of the vases in this section are bell-kraters, normally decorated with a two-figure composition on the obverse and with two draped youths on the reverse. Two kraters only, nos. 7 and 21, have a single figure on each side, one (no. 10) has a three-figure composition on the obverse; no. 23 has Dionysos and a silen on the reverse in place of the normal two draped youths. The two-figure compositions on the obverses are also very consistent; they normally depict Dionysos in the company of, most commonly, a satyr or bearded silen (19), the latter sometimes with white hair (4), Eros (4), a maenad (4), Pan (3) or a phlyax actor (7). Two kraters (nos. 19 and 45), and a skyphos (no. 33), show a phlyax scene without Dionysos, and comic masks appear on several other vases (nos. 9, 24, 33, 58). In the scenes themselves we may also note the frequent repetition of what are to become 'stock figures' in the Paestan repertory: (i) the half-draped seated youth or Dionysos, wearing a dotted fillet round his head, knotted at the back and decorated with ivy-leaves or white beads, and a piece of drapery, with a dot-stripe border, over the lower part of his body; (ii) a similar figure, but standing, bending slightly forward or running, with the piece of drapery across the front of the body or behind it and over one arm; (iii) the standing woman  or maenad, wearing a peplos with an overfall decorated with a double dot-stripe running down the centre, which veers slightly to "

The typical phlyax wears tights, often with white lines down the arms and legs to mark the seams, over which there is often a deep red jerkin to which a phallus is attached and on which the breasts are picked out in a pale pink; over this in turn there may be a well-padded short tunic, usually painted white, and so draped as to leave one shoulder bare.

Occasionally there is a wavy fold line, shaped somewhat like a double S, on the cloak of the youth to right, just above the left foot (e.g. on nos. 35, 44, 46-7, 59, 60, 64); it reappears on some of the later vases (e.g. nos. 170-5, 181, 183).

Bell-kraters All the bell-kraters have two-figure compositions on their obverses and Dionysos is represented on all but two (nos. 38 and 45). He is usually in the company of a young satyr (15 times), less frequently with a phlyax actor (5), Eros (3), Pan (3), a maenad, a bearded silen or a papposilen (twice each). In appearance he changes but little; he wears the customary dotted fillet round his head; when he is seated, a piece of drapery with a dot-stripe border covers the lower part of his body, when standing or running, he will have a similar piece of drapery over one arm (nos. 35, 37, 39, 42-3, 51), or else behind his legs, sometimes passing over the right thigh (as on nos. 36, 41, 59). He usually sits upon an enclosed white palmette or a tendril (as on nos. 50, 55, 60-2; cf. also the silen on no. 58), or by an altar (nos. 53, 63, 65), and, in addition to his thyrsus, may carry a drinking-horn (nos. 35, 37, 42, 63), a phiale (nos. 39, 44, 51, 57, 61), an egg (nos. 43, 50, 56, 60), or some other object such as a wreath, a bell or a tambourine.

As a result, the upper part of the hydria has been transformed into a sort of lid, which, when removed, reveals that the interor has been divided into three compartments, one filling half the available space, the other two a quarter each. Each compartment has a lid decorated in red-figure against an outline of black, the rest of the area being left reserved in red; on one of the lids there is also a female head on the underside matching the one on the other. The lids are all perforated with two holes, probably to facilitate their removal.

Like so many of the slaves in phlyax plays he has a very cunning look and is obviously out to cheat someone. The treatment of the eyes, nose, lips and chin on the heads which adorn the lids of the two smaller compartments find parallels on those beneath the handles of the hydriai we have already looked at, but the hair is rendered somewhat differently. The youth has a leafy wreath round his head, the curly hair on top of which assumes the shape of a series of waves; the two women both wear stephanai with tall radiate spikes and have curly hair with a large bun at back. Only one wears a head-dress, but both have large pendant earrings. It would seem that greater care has been lavished on these two heads than those on the hydriai; it may well be that a vase of such remarkable shape was a very special order. Neck-amphorae The slender, ovoid body of the neck-amphora hardly lends itself to the use of framing palmettes, which would have to be unusually tall to fill the space available. On the five neck-amphorae below no frames are used at all, and the pictures simply stand between the large palmette-fans beneath the handles. The heads on the necks are sometimes set in a metope-like frame (e.g. on nos. 88 and 91) formed by reserved stripes around them; on no. 91, and to a lesser extent on no. 88, it will be noted that the panel is some way down on the neck, leaving an area in black-glaze immediately above it (cf. also nos. 353-4 and 357 below).

The scene here represented, therefore, would appear to have no direct connec tion with the Euripidean tragedy, and Bieber, who is followed by Zahn, may be right in associating it with neither tragedy nor comedy, but with something more akin to a ""The literary references are given in Brommer, Herakles II (Darmstadt, 1984), pp. 21-2.

Between Ismenos and Krenaia is a half sun's disk, a popular device with Paestan artists, which serves the combined purpose of indicating the time of day and filling up an otherwise empty space. Ismenos was the name of the river that flowed to the east of Thebes, the 'lo-unvoO OScop which Theseus (Euripides, Suppl. 383) directs his herald to cross in order to reach the city. Hofer (ML, ii 1412) took Krenaia to be the personification of the KprjvocTai lluAai, but this seems an unnecessary complic ation, as she is surely no more than the nymph of the spring (Kpr)vr\), of which the serpent was the guardian. The early artist drew in the whole well-house; Asteas has merely suggested the presence of the spring by the pitcher, the rock and the plants growing beside it, and, most important of all, by putting in the nymph herself. Pausanias (ix, 10, 5) says that the fountain was sacred to Ares, who placed the serpent there to guard it, and it seems to have been called Melia in antiquity, after a nymph by whom Apollo had two sons. Euripides (Phoen. 931 ff.), however, makes the serpent-guarded spring that of Dirke, which flows into the similarly named stream near by, for when Menoeceus sacrifices himself by cutting his throat on the battlements of Thebes, he falls down into the cave where the guardian serpent lives. On the reverse is another Dionysiac scene comparable to those on nos. 126-8, and following the same general scheme, but with only three busts in the upper register, the fourth being replaced by a palmette-fan in added white above the head of Dionysos. The side of the vase has unfortunately suffered a good deal at the hands of the restorer, especially in the upper level and on the silen to right. We may note the presence of a duck by Dionysos; it will reappear on many later vases. The pictures on both sides are framed between plain reserved bands; on the obverse there is a white cross-piece at the top, suggestive of a column-capital as on nos. 125 and 127.

Nelisa is not found elsewhere, and may be a corruption of Melissa; but what about Tdpoc, Mpixr)cra and Aovooas? The second appears just below the bust of Hermes, and one may reasonably conclude that the artist, intending to name the nymph who is gathering the apples, allowed his eye to wander to the bust above and "

Such an interpretation is in keeping also with the normal arrangement of the figures on an Asteas vase—the mortals on the lower register, and above them the gods or various personifications to localise the scene. The obvious explanation is to make the T into the aspirate sign h and the name into hAPA, a form of Hera in which an alpha has been substituted for the eta. Hera deserves a place in the story because the gardens of the Hesperides were given to her as a wedding present, and because it was she who caused the twelve labours to be imposed upon Herakles. Further, as the enemy of Herakles she makes a good counterpart to Hermes, the Helper, who balances her on the right side of the tree. The other figure is inscribed AONAKIZ, and balances Pan. Early authorities read the first two letters as A0 and tried to transform her into Athena, but the letters are AO, and she has none of the attributes of that goddess. Donakis is a name otherwise unknown; one naturally assumes, as Patroni did, some connection with 86vcc£ — a reed.

Beneath the handle are superposed palmette-fans with sprung central leaves and elaborate side-scrolls terminating in an 'Asteas flower'. On either side of the lower fan are leaves with serrated edges. The design is a splendid example of a balanced composition; in fact, one so symmetrical as to be almost monotonous. In the centre is the tree with the serpent; each side of it is a group of three full-length figures, with two busts above them. The only variation lies in the grouping of the threes, and even there Nelisa is posed very similarly to Aiopis, and holds up an apple to her mouth like Antheia. The symmetry is emphasised by an almost isokephalic arrangement, despite the fact that not all the figures are standing, by the virtual absence of any connecting links between them, and by the fact that they all face the tree with their heads seen in profile. The drapery is the heavy, elaborately-patterned kind that is particularly dear to Asteas and his followers, and on this vase almost the whole repertory of patterns appears—stars and circles on the body of the garment, wave-pattern, palmettes, chequers and engrailing for the borders. Stripes run down the middle of the front of the chiton—plain with yellow beads or else in a fish-bone pattern. The drapery itself "
960,Pontecagnano,21481,"Ht. 6,", , ,"very mechanical way, with little regard for the actual position of the limbs. For instance, Aiopis, Nelisa and the apple-gatherer all have one leg drawn back, and yet the folds of their drapery fall in vertical lines to the ground as if both feet were placed flat together on it. The drapery of Calypso is very clumsy, especially about the waist and shoulder, and gives her the appearance of being wrapped up in it. Hermine Speier (RM 47, 1932, p. 57) points out changes that were taking place in sculptural poses and drapery in the second quarter of the fourth century B.C. and draws a good parallel between the figure of Athena on a documentary relief dating to the archonship of Molon in 362/1 and that of Aiopis on the Asteas lekythos (op. cit., pis. 21,1 and 2). We might, therefore, reasonably expect this vase to be dated late in that quarter of the century, contemporary with the bell-kraters and hydriai in the preceding chapter, which yield many parallels in both pose and drapery to the figures on the lekythos.31 The hair is for the most part rendered en masse, and is often done up with an elaborate head-band; if long, it hangs down on to the shoulders, with individual curls appearing only at the ends, and without relief lines to emphasise them. The very straight line for the back of Herakles is characteristic of the work of Asteas, especially for figures in this pose. The fired clay of the vase is far darker than that generally used by Asteas, with the result that the adjuncts in white and yellow show up more clearly, and the white of the serpent in the middle and of the apples on the tree makes a good contrast with the otherwise rather sober colouring.

His strong predilection for rigidly symmetrical compositions tends to give them a lifeless and artificial look; there are ready parallels to be found in the naiskos- and stele-scenes of later Apulian, which also make one wish for the freer disposition of the figures on the earlier kraters. If there is not much variety in the composition of his designs, there is, on the whole, even less in the figures which comprise them, since, in common with many other Italiote artists, Asteas has a habit of repeating his figures on different vases. He was quite capable of producing good, vigorous and original work, as the Cassandra fragment shows; but he is far too prone to allow his work to become mechanical, and the gestures of his figures often appear rather meaningless or purely conventional. "
970,Sydney, from T. 3711,Ht. 17, ,"PLATE U8a,b ","often he neglects it and makes elementary mistakes in the treatment of folds, etc., with the result that it tends to look heavy and lifeless. The expressions on the faces of his characters show a similar lifelessness; often in scenes of some emotion they appear almost frozen, and that is why the Cassandra fragment stands out so much above the other vases, for there is real feeling expressed in the faces of the three figures on it. His happiest results in this direction seem to have been attained on vases with comic subjects. Attention has already been drawn to the number of stock figures which appeared on the earlier and usually less elaborate vases of Asteas; these we find repeated on the signed ones, especially on the reverses of the kraters, where the Dionysiac scenes are merely larger-scale versions of those on the vases in Chapter IV. These include the running figure, male or female, with arms spread out, the standing draped woman, the male figure bending forward over one raised foot, and the bearded silen. The following minor features of his drawing are worth noting: a tendency to arch the eyebrow well above the eye, instead of using three almost parallel strokes like Python; the highlighting of the eye with a touch of white; the straight forehead-nose line (very noticeable on the Hesperides lekythos) and the curving line to mark the nostril; the flat line of the back, when a figure is bending forward over a raised leg (as with Dionysos on the reverse of no. 128 or Herakles on no. 135—cf. also nos. 74—5, 93—4); the careful rendering of hands and figures, with a tendency to taper the latter off to rather sharp points. Asteas seldom draws heads in any but a profile view; his three-quarter faces (Helle, the mad Herakles, the silen on the reverse of no. 127) show that he can, in fact, render them with considerable skill and effect, and it is rather surprising that he makes so little use of them and never of a completely frontal face. Relief lines are generally used for the hair, but on the less important characters, it may simply be blocked in on the head, with a mass of curls falling down onto the shoulders. He continues his use of dot-striped drapery, so "

In the first, the subjects, whether Dionysiac or mythological, are treated in a more elaborate manner, with multi-figured compositions in which the principal characters wear richly-patterned garments; in the second the compositions are simpler, usually with only two figures, and carry on the tradition of his earlier work, as exemplified by the vases discussed in Chapter IV.

Note also the treatment of the rocks on no. 152 (cf. those on the two Cadmus vases, nos. 132 and 141), the dotted stem of the palmette leaves on no. 152, the use of small white palmette-fans (no. 153; cf. also no. 154). More use is made than usual on smaller vases of added colours, especially white and orange-yellow, as well as black and various shades of red; this gives these three vases a bright and colourful appearance, and there is an unusually light-hearted look about them, especially in the scene on no. 154, where the boy offers a grasshopper to a most attractive looking hoopoe, with black and white crest, wings and tail (cf. no. 186). The papposilen on no. 152 is also drawn with a very lively look, and the rendering of the tufts of white hair on his body, partly as dots and partly as short lines, is unusual.

The characters represented on these vases often wore more elaborate drapery than would normally appear on what may be called the 'standard' vases, where the decoration is usually confined to a dot-stripe either running down the peplos or chiton or else serving as a border pattern. On these vases less use is made of added colours; they are mainly confined to adjuncts and to the small pieces of red drapery which appear across the bodies of women or of Eros, especially on the lebetes gamikoi. The vases fall broadly into three divisions, the first consisting of kraters and amphorae, mostly with two draped youths on the reverses, the second of lebetes gamikoi, usually with very elaborate lids, and decorated with scenes in which lavers play a prominent part, and the third of other shapes, generally decorated with scenes representing Dionysos and his followers or Eros.

It is divided into two registers—below, Dionysos between two maenads; above, two half-length figures of young satyrs and a three-quarter length one of Pan, who raises both his arms in a gesture of surprise. The maenad on the left perhaps owes something to the similar one on Asteas's signed krater in Madrid; the vertical stripe of wave-pattern, however, is an innovation. Dionysos obviously owes a good deal to the work of Asteas, but there is a difference in the actual drawing, especially of the head, in the treatment of the hair and the eye. The hair of Asteas's male figures generally falls on to the shoulder in a solid mass, with perhaps a few individual curls sketched in at the edges; with Python the mass tends to break up into a number of separate locks of hair, which fall in a rather mat-like formation down on to the front side of the shoulder (cf. also nos. 230, 233, 238).

I would have little hesitation in giving the vase to Python, as it seems to me closely comparable to the two signed vases, its reverse being particularly close to that of the amphora (no. 240). There is the long, straight nose with the deep-set eyes (cf. especially Pylades, who in this respect resembles Antenor), the same elaborate drapery with the fine fold-lines in thinned glaze, and the same treatment of the hair, which falls in a mat like series of locks down on to the shoulders. The three figures on the lower register of the reverse will all reappear on other unsigned vases. We may also note the half solar disk above the picture, as on no. 241 (cf. also no. 350 below). Like the two signed vases, the Orestes krater bears witness to Python's fondness for a plentiful use of added colours—shades of yellow and orange, white, red and purple—which give the obverse a lively look. Its surface, however, is far too crowded and the composition is poor. The figures are clumsily placed; the Fury on the right has hardly room to stand and her wings look quite absurd; Orestes looks as if he had been pinned on to the omphalos, and the drawing of Apollo's legs is unconvincing. It is Python in his more pretentious vein and it perhaps deserves Beazley's designation of it as a 'monstrosity'. Another bell-krater is perhaps rather more successful than the Orestes krater; it had a long and interesting history15 before it came to rest in the Vatican. "

1473,Paestum, from C. Spina,Ht. 25, , ,"against the everyday type (pp. 61-2). There can be no doubt of the strong Dionysiac element in the scene on our vase, strengthened by the presence of the papposilen and the young satyr-boy, as well as by the three masks, but whether these are intended as symbols of the incorporation of the three banqueters into the Dionysiac thiasos, seems to me open to question. Dionysos was god of drama, and a symposium, especially with such a theatrical connection as we have here, seems a very likely way in which to render homage to the god, as successful actors might well wish to do; symposia are obviously a favourite theme with Python, since he depicted them on no fewer than seven vases, of which three are of recent discovery and were not known to Hurschmann, who lists only four on pp. 197-8.17 The Dionysiac scene on the reverse is more carefully drawn than are most of its kind. In the centre sits Dionysos between a maenad and a silen, while above appear the busts of a similar-looking pair. There is a strong general resemblance between the figures here and those on the Orestes krater, especially between the silens on the right of the two designs, but the drawing on our vase is better, and the extremely good state of preservation gives the figures a sharpness which on the Orestes krater they do not possess. The obverse, too, has marked affinities with the style of Python, especially in the rendering of the faces. Remove the pilos of Antenor, and the resemblance between him and the two diners on the left is most pronounced. There is the characteristic mat-like hair, the fondness for elaborate drapery, the extensive use of white dots and of shades of yellow and orange which we have noted on others of his vases, and there can be little doubt that here we have one of his own works. This is important because, like the Orestes krater, this vase illustrates a number of the stock characters of his repertory. The phlyax masks will serve as the models for the features of a number of phlyakes, and the maenad on the reverse and the diners on the obverse will all appear again on later vases. One small point in Python's drawing of a phlyax mask is the pronounced ridge at the bottom of the forehead, just above the dip of the 16On the game of kottabos see, in particular, Brian Sparkes, 'Kottabos: an Athenian after-dinner game', in Archaeology 13, 1960, pp. 202 ff.

1494,Paestum, from C. Arcioni (1978),Ht. 16, , ,"Oineus to his throne. In that case the scene here must be interpreted as showing Agrios, as a prisoner, since his hands are bound, seated upon an altar, beside which emerges a black Fury, and the aged Oineus, with his younger second wife Periboia and his grandson Diomedes. The scene, therefore, might be taken as illustrating the denouement of the play, when Periboia brings along the aged Oineus, who has now resumed his royal rank, as his costume and sceptre indicate, and to whom Diomedes holds out the sword with which he may take vengeance upon Agrios, an act symbolised by the presence of the black Fury. The use of black in this context is interesting since Aeschylus speaks of the Furies as sable-garbed (Choeph. 1049; Eum. 370). Stylistically the vase follows very closely on the Alkmene krater; the drapery is less elaborate, but the parallel between Oineus and Agrios and the principal figures on the obverse of the Alkmene vase is very clear. The king has the same long face, large nose, deep-set eyes and narrow shoulders of Zeus or Amphitryon, and the youth and woman both have the long nose and rounded chin which were a feature of Python's people. There are also points of resemblance in the treatment of the drapery, and there is the same meander and chequered square pattern below the picture, a decorative motive favoured more by Python than by Asteas. Beneath the handles are the usual female heads, though with the one to right the upper part of the body is also shown, draped in a dot-stripe bordered himation. Both have one raised hand visible; the hair is caught up in a saccos on the left and a beaded sphendone on the right. The other hydria (no. 250) shows the familiar scene of the meeting of Orestes, "

This section deals with what may be termed Python's standard vases, among which bell-kraters (division i) and neck-amphorae (division ii) predominate. These are normally decorated with a two-figure composition on the obverse and two draped youths on the reverse, though, especially on those of smaller dimensions, the decoration may be reduced to a single figure on one or both sides. Python also decorated vases of other shapes (division iii), but it seems clear that he had a marked preference for the bell-krater, which he normally decorates with Dionysiac themes of various kinds. It is remarkable how seldom female figures appear on bell-kraters, and then usually as maenads, either with Dionysos or a silen. Only once (on no. 280) does a woman appear in local costume along with a warrior, although this is a theme especially popular with the Campanian vase-painters at this time, and is used frequently in the painted decoration of Paestan tombs. The extreme uniformity of shape and decoration on the bell-kraters produces an effect of monotony, which is occasionally relieved by the presence of a suspended mask or a face in the window, or by an unusual treatment of a stock theme.

Three vases (nos. 286-7 and 299) show a symposium, in which the scenes on nos. 245-7 are reproduced in a somewhat simplified form.

Odysseus, wearing a red chiton and a pilos, is standing bound to the mast of the ship, which is passing beside the rocks on which are seated the Sirens, one of whom holds a lyre and the other a tambourine. The attitudes of the crew vary; their ears have been stopped with wax, so most of them carry on as if nothing untoward was happening, and look at the Sirens in frank amazement. The helmsman, however, has played for safety, and wrapped himself up completely in his red cloak, letting the steering-oar follow its own devices. The boat itself is a small affair; the prow is in the form of a swan's head, and the bow, which resembles the snout of a pig, has a large apotropaic eye painted upon it, with long, curling lashes. The sea is represented by waves which might easily be mistaken for grass; to make quite sure nobody will be deceived, Python has added three small fish in white as well. Even as it is, the possition of the oars looks curious, but originally the first one had been drawn sloping to the left. In view of its multi-figured composition this vase ought perhaps to have been placed with Python's more elaborate vases, but the fact that its reverse is decorated with two draped youths suggests that he himself did not so regard it. The miniaturisation of the figures has contributed greatly to the success of the vase, which Beazley calls 'a commendable sea-piece'. The figures on the obverse are mostly smaller scale versions of others on the larger vases (e.g. Amphitryon, the Clouds), and the extensive use of added red, with a good deal of white, enlivens the vase without dominating it.

In shape, subject-matter, treatment and pattern-work, some of these amphorae stand very close to nos. 182-4 by Asteas, but their reverses seem to associate them more with Python. The mouth is fairly wide, with an overhanging lip, beneath which there is sometimes a reserved band. The neck, which is quite tall, is most commonly decorated with a female head, sometimes in a metope-like panel framed by reserved bands, beneath which will be bands of wave or tongues and sometimes both (e.g. on no. 347). Sometimes a siren replaces the female head on the obverse (e.g. nos. 347, 349, 355), and sometimes a palmette is found instead on the reverse (e.g. nos. 353, 357, 366); on the smaller vases there are palmettes on both sides. Occasionally the head or palmette is set comparatively low down on the neck, leaving a substantial area in black above it (e.g. nos. 353^, 357). The shoulder is usually decorated with a wreath of laurel, sometimes with a white and yellow flower in the centre, but only on the obverse (nos. 347, 349, 355); tongues are occasionally used instead, especially on the reverses (e.g. nos. 350-1, 353, 357), although they appear on both sides of the smaller vases.

She thought the scene more probably depicted suppliants and suggested, as an alternative, that it represented the children of Herakles—Makaria seated upon the altar, with one of her brothers on either side. She thought the two busts might represent two of Makaria's sisters, but, as we have seen, such busts in Paestan often seem to have no specific identity, but rather merely to represent spectators. The reverse represents two youths, draped in himatia with dot-stripe borders; on the rather tall neck, on each side, set into a framed oblong panel, are the head and shoulders of a woman in profile to left.

(vii) the painter is fond of representing the hair of women with a large bunch sticking up at the back and tied round by a white ribbon, sometimes with dot-clusters at the ends; otherwise a sphendone or kekryphalos is used, generally decorated with black and white dots, with a bunch of solid black hair at the back. Makaria's hair is cut short, as a suppliant, but the touch of pink on her cheek is very much after the manner of Python. In shape the amphora is close to those already attributed to Asteas and Python; the neck is slightly taller than usual and the handles are ribbed, as on Python's signed amphora.

We should also note the rendering of the faces with the very heavy chins, the slight downward curve to the mouth and the general look of severity, which is very apparent in the heads below the handles of the hydriai (nos. 406-9) as well as on the standing draped woman on no. 408 and the seated half-draped woman on nos. 410^11. The skyphos (no. 405) is similar in decoration to no. 402, with the same red fillets looped over the cross-bars of the triangles in the top left corners, and the half-visible laver is also closely comparable, with the same black lines for the fluting on the pedestal; physically the seated Dionysos reminds us of the youth to left on the obverse of no. 379 and the head of the woman on the reverse recalls that of the woman on no. 395, but is still closer to the head below the left handle of no. 406. The heads below the handles of the four hydriai (nos. 406-9) have much in common between them—the downward curve of the mouth, the heavy, rounded chin, the drawing of the eyes, and, despite superficial differences, look to be the work of one painter (cf. also the heads on no. 410).

The lebes gamikos, the present whereabouts of which is not known to me, is a remarkable vase; the lid was in two main sections, consisting of a lebes gamikos resting upon a lekanis; the lid of the upper part is broken and the knob is missing. The decoration on both parts consisted of a female head and a bird. The hair on each of the heads was bound up with a deep red sphendone; the bird on the lekanis portion looks like a duck; the one on the lebes above is speckled, with a circle of dots round the eye, perhaps a thrush of some kind. The shoulder on the obverse was decorated with plastic female heads, with long hair, the visible flesh being painted black; on the reverse are the usual pagoda-like conical knobs. The scene on the obverse shows a youth, the central part of whose body is covered with a piece of drapery with a wave-pattern border, holding a mirror in his right hand and a phiale and red fillet in his left. He faces a woman, draped in a peplos, again with a wave-pattern on the overfall and the V-shaped opening at the neck; over her left shoulder and down her back falls a piece of drapery which she holds with her right hand at her left breast. The upper part of the drapery is covered with a mass of small vertical fold-lines running down to the overfall, on which the fold-lines bunch in downward-pointing fan-like clusters. On the lower part, they fall very straight to the hem, except over the bent left leg, where they appear as short horizontal strokes. Besides her is a laver, only half of which is shown; on it sits a small Eros, with wings spreading upwards. The ground-line is shown as pebbles, some in white, and the youth stands upon a slight eminence. In the top left corner is a long fillet in added red, falling vertically to the left and on the right flapping horizontally in a wavy line. It is looped over the reserved band beneath the egg-pattern at the top of the picture. The design of the reverse is simpler and shows an Eros bending forward over his raised left foot in front of a standing draped woman, who wears a "

We now have at least one, and possibly two, other vases by this painter who is an artist of no great merit, but is possessed of a very characteristic style, which manifests itself particularly in his drawing of the faces. Those of the figures on the body and below the handles of the hydria provide excellent illustrations of this. We should note the drawing of (i) the eye—three more or less parallel strokes for the brow and upper lid, a large black dot for the pupil, (ii) the mouth—deep set, with thick lips and a substantial indent above the rounded chin, (iii) the nose—short, curving lines to mark the nostril; straight, slightly concave brow-nose line, (iv) the hair—shown as a solid black mass, sometimes with straggly curls around the ear. These features will also be found on the neck-amphora (no. 422). The treatment of the drapery is also noteworthy. On the hydria, the woman wears a long peplos, with a central double dot-stripe which falls vertically down to the lower hem, her right leg is bent at the knee and over the thigh the fold-lines of the drapery are shown as a series of double horizontal strokes, slightly curved; similar vertical fold-lines appear on the chlamys of the youth, the small weights at the corners of which are clearly shown. The owl between the two is a formidable bird, with staring eyes. The woman on the obverse of the neck-amphora wears a similar peplos, but has a piece of drapery drawn up over her head to serve as a veil, and falling over her left shoulder, enveloping her left arm.

The drawing of their faces, however, places them here. On the neck of the obverse is a female head, wearing a radiate stephane, and on the reverse an owl, of somewhat less ferocious aspect than on the hydria. Below the handles are superposed palmette-fans, with detached side-tendrils of a fairly early type (cf.
