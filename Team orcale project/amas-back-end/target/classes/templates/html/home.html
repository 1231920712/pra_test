            South Italian is a designation for ancient <a href="#">Greek pottery</a> fabricated in
            <a href="#">Magna Graecia</a> largely during the 4th century BC. The fact that Greek Southern Italy produced
            its own <a href="#">red-figure pottery</a> as early as the end of the 5th century B.C. was first established
            by Adolf Furtwaengler in 1893 (<a href="#">A.D. Trendall</a>). Prior to that this pottery had been first
            designated as "Etruscan" and then as "Attic."

            Archaeological proof that this pottery was actually being produced in South Italy first came in 1973 when a
            workshop and kilns with misfirings and broken wares was first excavated at Metaponto, proving that the
            <a href="#">Amykos Painter</a> was located there rather than in Athens (A.D. Trendall, p. 17).
